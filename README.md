# Identify Impact of Restaurant Location on Success in Yelp


Yelp, founded in 2004, is a multinational corporation that publishes crowd-sourced online reviews on local businesses. 
The website provides information of products or services, such as address, contact information and business hours. Yelp users can rate the business from 1-5 stars and write their own reviews on the products or services. Yelp ratings are often considered as a reputation metric for businesses. Surveys indicate that the most frequent activity done by Yelp users is to 
search restaurants by defining nearby location. 

In this project, the team used star ratings to categorize 520 open restaurants in Pittsburg into either low-rating or high rating class. Then the 
team would first use location (longitude and latitude) of restaurants as classifiers and three statistical learning methods (KNN, Parzen windows, and SVM) to classify the restaurants, which 
we defined as location mining objective. The second objective was to evaluate the rating system 
by using all selected business features and two methods (SVM and Random Forests) to classify 
the restaurants. 

The experiment results showed the random forest algorithm based classification 
gave us best performance and lowest misclassification rate with 0.20, which was much better than any other papers published in Yelp past data challenge competition.
